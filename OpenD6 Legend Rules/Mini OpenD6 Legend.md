Mini OpenD6 Legend Rules
========================

These are rules for adapting OpenD6 style games to Legend style dice 
rolls, where players roll and count the number of successes as opposed 
to totaling the dice and comparing the result against a target number. 

**Target Successes (TS)**: This is the minimum number of successes 
(rolling 4 or higher on a D6) you need to achieve in order to 
succeed at whatever you are attempting. Target Successes function 
under the Legend System similarly to the way Target Numbers work 
under traditional OpenD6.

To convert between Target Numbers (TN) and Target Success (TS), 
divide the TN by 7, rounding up or down as you see fit.


Dice Basics
-----------

Dice are rolled just as in OpenD6 or Mini Six. For every die that 
rolls a 4 or higher, the character gets one success. 

Any pips are added to the Wild Dieâ€™s result, with a result of a 4 
or higher counting as a success. If a 6 is rolled on the wild die, 
then the pips are added to the bonus die.

If for any reason a die ever gets a +3, then the +3 is removed, but the 
number of dice is increased by 1. So, 4D+3 would become 5D.


Combat
------

For damage, you can just total up the damage values as in traditional 
OpenD6, or you can let each damage success that is not soaked equals 
one damage level taken.


Optional Combat Focus Rules
---------------------------

Players may take a -1D penalty during their round in order to receive 
a +1D bonus to one kind of combat roll (attack, defense, damage, or 
soak). This gives characters more flexibility in combat without adding 
a lot of extra rules.
